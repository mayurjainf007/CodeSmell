# Project Instructions

This project detects code smells in Python scripts, generates reports, and visualizes the results using various charts.

## Files Overview

1. **detect_code_smells.py**:
   - Detects code smells in machine learning code snippets.
   - Uses predefined rules and a trained machine learning model.

2. **generate_report.py**:
   - Generates a detailed report based on the results from `detect_code_smells.py`.
   - Outputs a CSV file summarizing detected code smells.

3. **train_model.py**:
   - Trains the machine learning model used for detecting code smells.
   - Saves the trained model and vectorizer for later use.

4. **visualization_code_smells.py**:
   - Creates various visualizations based on the detected code smells.
   - Includes bar charts, pie charts, and stacked bar charts.

## Instructions to Run the Project

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. Use the following command to install the required libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Train the Model
Before detecting code smells, ensure the model is trained:
```
python train_model.py
```

### Step 3: Detect Code Smells
Run the `detect_code_smells.py` script on your dataset:
```
python detect_code_smells.py
```

### Step 4: Generate a Report
Generate a detailed report using the following command:
```
python generate_report.py
```

### Step 5: Visualize Code Smells
Visualize the results using the `visualization_code_smells.py` script:
```
python visualization_code_smells.py
```

## Output Files
- **`code_smell_results.csv`**: Contains the detected code smells.
- **Visualizations**: Stored in the `images/` folder.

## Notes
- Ensure the dataset is in the expected format with a `code_block` column.
- Update paths and configurations in scripts if necessary.
