# codeSmell
Code smells are indicators of potential structural weaknesses in code that could lead to maintainability and scalability issues. While not bugs, they make the code more complex and harder to modify. Detecting code smells manually is both time consuming and subjective. Therefore, automated solutions are essential, especially in large-scale projects.
